# Pre-Commit Hook Rule

Always run pre-commit hooks before making any git commits or when making file changes.

## Flawless Commit Workflow - MANDATORY STEPS

**BEFORE EVERY COMMIT, execute these exact steps in order:**

### Step 1: Run Tests (MANDATORY)
```bash
tox -e fast
```
**OR for quick local testing:**
```bash
pytest
```
- Tests MUST pass before proceeding
- Exit code 0 = Tests passed → Continue to Step 2
- Exit code 1 = Tests failed → STOP and fix tests
- **NEVER skip this step** - failing tests = do not commit

### Step 2: Stage All Changes
```bash
git add .
```
- Stage ALL files including new/modified/deleted
- This ensures pre-commit checks everything

### Step 3: Run Pre-Commit (First Pass)
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
- Exit code 0 = All passed → Go to Step 5
- Exit code 1 = Auto-fixes applied → Go to Step 4

### Step 4: Stage Auto-Fixes and Re-Run
If Step 3 failed (exit code 1):
```bash
git add -u
pre-commit run --all-files
```
- `git add -u` stages the auto-fixed files
- Re-run pre-commit to verify
- Exit code 0 = All passed → Go to Step 5
- Exit code 1 = Still failing → Report error to user

### Step 5: Commit
Once all tests pass AND pre-commit returns exit code 0:
```bash
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
```

### Step 6: Push (Optional)
If user wants to push changes:
```bash
git push
```

### Step 7: Check GitHub Actions (After Push)
After pushing, check if CI/CD pipelines pass:
```bash
gh run list --limit 5
```
- Monitor the triggered workflows
- Wait ~30-60 seconds and check status again if in progress
- If any workflow fails, investigate with:
```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```
- Report failures to the user with details

## AI Assistant Instructions

When the user asks to commit or when you're ready to commit changes:

1. **ALWAYS** run tests FIRST (Step 1) - This is mandatory, no exceptions
2. **NEVER** proceed if tests fail - Fix tests before continuing
3. **ALWAYS** execute Steps 1-5 above in sequence
4. **NEVER** skip the loop (Step 4) if pre-commit modifies files
5. **NEVER** commit if pre-commit exits with code 1
6. **ALWAYS** check the exit code and act accordingly
7. If tests or pre-commit fail twice, explain the issue to the user

**After Pushing (Steps 6-7):**
- When user says "push" or "deploy", execute git push
- **ALWAYS** check GitHub Actions runs after pushing
- Wait 30-60 seconds and check status with `gh run list --limit 5`
- If workflows fail, investigate with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- Report any failures to the user with clear details
- Offer to fix issues if CI/CD fails

**Testing Options:**
- **Preferred:** `tox -e fast` (isolated environment, fast)
- **Alternative:** `pytest` (quick local test)
- **Full coverage:** `tox -e coverage` (for major changes)

## Exit Code Handling

Understanding pre-commit exit codes is critical:

- **Exit Code 0** = Success, all checks passed → Safe to commit
- **Exit Code 1** = Either:
  - Auto-fixes were applied (trailing whitespace, end-of-file, etc.) → Stage and re-run
  - OR validation failed (syntax errors, large files, secrets) → Fix manually

**The key:** After auto-fixes, you MUST stage them and re-run. Don't commit until you get exit code 0.

## When This Rule Applies

Trigger this workflow when:
- ✅ User asks to commit changes
- ✅ You're about to suggest `git commit`
- ✅ After editing Python, YAML, JSON, TOML, or any tracked files
- ✅ When user says "commit this" or similar

## What NEVER to Do

- ❌ NEVER commit with `--no-verify` (unless user explicitly requests)
- ❌ NEVER skip the auto-fix loop (Step 3)
- ❌ NEVER commit if pre-commit exits with code 1
- ❌ NEVER assume files are clean without running pre-commit

## Example Execution

```bash
# User says: "commit and push this"

# Step 1: Run tests (MANDATORY)
pytest
# → Exit code 0 (all tests passed!) ✅
# OR: tox -e fast

# Step 2: Stage everything
git add .

# Step 3: First run
pre-commit run --all-files
# → Exit code 1 (trailing whitespace fixed)

# Step 4: Stage fixes and retry
git add -u
pre-commit run --all-files
# → Exit code 0 (success!)

# Step 5: Commit
git commit -m "Fix broken images and optimize assets"
# → Success! ✅

# Step 6: Push
git push
# → Pushed to remote ✅

# Step 7: Check GitHub Actions
gh run list --limit 5
# → Shows triggered workflows

# Wait 30-60 seconds...
gh run list --limit 5
# → Check if workflows completed successfully
# → If any failed, investigate:
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
# → Report issue to user and offer to fix
```

**If tests fail:**
```bash
# Step 1: Run tests
pytest
# → Exit code 1 (test_calculator.py::test_divide FAILED)

# STOP! Do not proceed
# Fix the failing test first
# Re-run tests until they pass
# Then continue with Step 2
```

**If GitHub Actions fail:**
```bash
# Step 7: Check shows failure
gh run list --limit 5
# → "Deploy Learning UI" failed

# Investigate
gh run view 21689736165 --log-failed
# → Shows: "cp: cannot stat 'index.html': No such file or directory"

# Fix the issue (e.g., update workflow file)
# Commit and push the fix
# Check again until all workflows pass ✅
```
